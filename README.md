# The Fantasy RPG Engine
The license pertaining to this engine pertains only to the source code files that were written by me, Volke0.  Other files (such as the resoource folder whose link is provided below) are NOT covered by the license.

The library dependency cpp_assert.hpp is also NOT included under the license due to the code being used by another source online and me heavily modifying it.

# Compiling the Engine
To compile this engine you need to have the following packages installed via vcpkg:
- jsoncpp
- boost--algorithm
- raylib

(Make sure to run the filename:x64-windows install for each package as well!)

After all of the above are installed make sure to then run "vcpkg integrate install" without the quotes.

Once that is all taken care of, you must then launch the .sln to then compile the engine and voila! 

# Setting up the Engine
Make sure to check out my example game to see how this thing runs and the documentation included in the appropiate folders as well.
But, to make this example game run you need to download the **resources** folder for this thing to work --> https://www.mediafire.com/file/3b1l2pa5zu7e1xi/resources.rar/file

Make sure you include it in the same folder as the .exe AND the databases for the program to run!
